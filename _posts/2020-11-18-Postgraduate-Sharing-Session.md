&emsp;NUS IEEE-HKN organized a Postgraduate Sharing Session, which was attended by 18 NUS Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) undergraduates, to give a clear understanding of what a postgraduate life and program are like. Participants listened to the sharing from two Ph.D. students from the department of ECE NUS - Ng Hong Jie, who is doing research in Quantum Communication, and Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Thao, who is doing research in Neuromorphic Computing.

&emsp;Participants got to hear and learn about preparations that can be done during undergraduate studies, general Ph.D. program and application process, research topics, possible future plans, Ph.D. scholarships in Singapore, and even daily life as Ph.D. students. They also got the chance to directly ask questions to the two Ph.D. students at the end of the session.

&emsp;We appreciate the time that the speakers have spared out of their busy schedule and of the same importance, we also thank the participants who have joined the session despite it being held in a reading week. We hope that despite it being held online, participants still find the sharing session meaningful and helpful for their future careers!
